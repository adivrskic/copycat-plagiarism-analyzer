# Copycat Plagiarism Analyzer

This application allows users to upload documents or enter text, and then scans the web
to determine the plagiarism % of the text.

I created this application to learn more about Python, the Flask framework and web scraping.
Additional technologies include Bulma for CSS, BeautifulSoup for scraping, and Scikit-learn for vector comparisons.
